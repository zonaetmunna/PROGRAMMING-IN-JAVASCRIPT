# javascript Programming

## Basic Javascript

#### what is Javascript

- Javascript is a high level programming language.
- It operates as lightweight, cross-platform, just-in-time (jit) language.
- unlike compiled language, javascript is an interpreted Script language.
- abbreviated as js, it offers dynamic typing, prototype-based object orientation and first class functions.
- Javascript widely used for building interactive web application, but now javscriptt used for backend, mobile app, desktop application.

#### Feature of javascript or advantages of javascript

Here are some of the key features of javascript

- dynamic typing: Javascript supports dynamic typing, meaning that the type of a variable can change during runtime.
- interactivity: Javascript enables interactivity on web pages, such as form validation, mouse events, and animation
- prototype-based: JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance, allowing objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.
- multi-paradigm: JavaScript supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming.
- single threaded: JavaScript operates on a single-threaded event loop model, executing one task at a time in a non-blocking manner.
- object-oriented: Javascript is an object-oriented language, that allows the creation of objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- cross-platform: javascript is a cross plat-form language, meaning it can run multiple platforms, such as browser, servers, and desktops.
- asynchronous: JavaScript is designed to be non-blocking, allowing for asynchronous execution of code, making it well suited for handling multiple complex tasks at once.
- event driven: Javascript is event-driven, meaning it can respond to events such as clicks scrolls and form-submissions
- Partial and widely used: Javascript has partial native support for common programming concept, such as arrays, loops, function, and conditional statements

## simple problem solving

#### javascript fundamental

1. Write a JavaScript program to compare two objects to determine if the first contains equivalent property values to the second one

2. Copy a string to the clipboard

3. Converts a comma-separated values string to a 2D array

4. Convert a comma-separated values string to a 2D array of objects
5. Convert an array of objects to a comma-separated values string that contains only the columns specified
